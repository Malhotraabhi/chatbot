# chatbot
An AI chatbot that lets users upload PDFs and ask questions about them. It uses Gemini, LangGraph, FAISS, and Streamlit to retrieve relevant text, call helpful tools, and give accurate, context-aware answers. Each chat thread is saved, making the system simple, fast, and reliable for document understanding.
